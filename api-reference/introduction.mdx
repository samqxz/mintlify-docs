## Welcome

There are two ways to open the API Reference Editor: [APIEditor](http://eskdaleroleplaycommunity.api/apieditor/privateservers/server/) and [ERC Editor](http://eskdaleroleplaycommunity.api/editor/reference/code/). For the starter kit, we are using the following API Editor specification.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```
